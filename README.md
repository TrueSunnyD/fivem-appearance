# brime-fivem-appearance

This is something i converted for my server a couple of days ago. I do not take any credit for the UI all I've done is converted the LUA side for the clothing shops, barber shops and saved outfits from https://github.com/ZiggyJoJo/brp-fivem-appearance

Orginal Script + UI: https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-fivem-appearance/2438537
